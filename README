This is my rendition of ' Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts ', from Codecademy

I changed up a lot of stuff in this project, just to get a different visual identity, but the spirit of the project is the same.

I hope you like it, and please feel free to make suggestions.

PS: beware of the links, they might frustrate you deepply.
